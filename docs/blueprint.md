# **App Name**: DevilsLab Reimagined

## Core Features:

- 3D Hero Background: Replicate the interactive 3D particle background using Three.js for the hero section.
- GSAP Animations: Implement all existing animations using GSAP, including scroll triggers and transitions.
- Page Routing: Implement page routing using Next.js App Router to navigate between the home and forum pages.
- Modal Implementation: Implement the SyncGalaxy modal with the proper animations using GSAP.
- Maintain functional fidelity: Add test scripts that verify functional fidelity, including mousemove behavior.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark navy blue (#1A1A2E) for a sophisticated and modern feel.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F9FA) provides a clean and subtle contrast.
- Accent color: Dark grayish blue (#0F3460), analogous to the primary, provides a more pronounced visual contrast without disrupting the main visual emphasis.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable, and versatile look.
- Use a set of streamlined icons sourced from a library like FontAwesome or Remix Icon. All icons must match the style found in the provided html document.
- Maintain the existing layout structure, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes, and follow established standards in UI design and ensure consistency across the site.
- Replicate all the existing animations using GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform) as defined in the original HTML file to add depth to interactions, transitions, and the overall user experience. It is important that no functionality is lost during the transfer from HTML to NextJS, including animation.
